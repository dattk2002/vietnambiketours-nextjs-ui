            Vietnam & Thailand Ly I hope you had a great New Year’s. We are back
            to work and very busy. First I’m checking to see how much we owe for
            the additional hotel in Bangkok and if I have any other charges I
            need to make good on. We had a great vacation and haven’t had time
            to do our reviews but in Thailand Al and our driver were excellent
            which made our trip even better. Please Thank Al again we don’t have
            any contact info for him We our already thinking about next year

            Subject: Cycle Mekong delta, Vietnam Good afternoon Khanh Ly, I just
            wanted to tell you what a wonderful time we had cycling through the
            Mekong Delta, and how much we enjoyed having Mr. Trong as our guide.
            Thank you so much for accommodating us, and for being flexible as we
            figured out how to pay our bill! My parents have cycled many miles
            through many countries, and both agreed that this was their favorite
            trip. When we get settled back home I will be sure to write a proper
            review of our experience with Vietnam Bike Tours. Thank you again,
            and we hope to ride with you again some day. Regards, Annie,

            From: michael pritchard &lt;m.p...@yahoo.com&gt; Subject: Laos to
            Vietnam Date: 5 January 2020 at 10:50:46 GMT+7 To: Tom Partridge Hey
            Tom, Were just about over our jet lag so I thought Id send some
            feedback on our trip from Luang prabang to Hanoi. First of all,
            I&apos;d like to say It was a great adventure. We definitely got off
            the tourist track and saw the country and the people from a
            different angle. I think the first leg, in Laos was my favorite. The
            combination of backroads, wonderful people, good foods and great
            guides made the long dusty days enjoyable, Mr Xee Xong was super
            caring and attentive to our needs and desires. he kept great track
            of everyone and made sure we got good lodging, arranged dinners and
            explained the routes to us as best he could. Whoever worked out the
            boat ride/shuttle/boa tride on the Nam Ou was genius because none of
            us relished the alternative. Mr So did a good job as backup guide
            and mechanic. As you know, these are not top of the line bikes, so
            keeping the derailleurs operating in the dusty conditions was a
            challenge. The drivers were a great support in many ways.. Once we
            got into Vietnam we had to adjust to the new guide and driver. It
            was difficult to go from 2 guides and 2 drivers to one guide and one
            driver. Mr Quinn took some getting used to as well. I appreciate his
            knowledge of the many bike routes along the way. They took us off
            the main track through some wonderful country. One trouble, however
            was his inability or unwillingness to communicate the intended route
            for the day. Since we were familiar with the itinerary we could let
            him know what we felt up for that day. When he changed the route for
            the day without explanation, which was most days, we felt a bit at
            his mercy. This bothered some more than others. I do think that on a
            tour like this, a brief description of the day ahead is important
            information for the client to have. The lodging was mostly good to
            great, but some of those mega resorts like in Dien Bien Foo and Cuc
            Phong were a little much. It was nice to have the last few days to
            just relax on the cruise in Halong Bay. So, I think this tour was
            wonderful. We would have enjoyed knowing ahead that the itinerary is
            subject to change and that Mileages and elevations may differ from
            those on the itinerary. Choosing guides, like Mr Xee that can
            communicate the plan and the options available to us would be much
            more professional. Also, a page on the website with info on visas,
            changing money, suggested immunizations, etc would simplify
            preparation. You said that you don&apos;t get much feed back, so
            here you go. I hope it is useful. We&apos;d love to return someday
            for another tour. Michael Pritchard

            9:19 PM subject:Review of our trip March, 2019 Please forward this
            review to Li I just completed a Trip Advisor review, giving an
            overall rating of 4 for our trip. I thought more complete feedback
            might be helpful to you. Positives: 1. Both of our guides tried very
            hard to make our trip enjoyable. They were very good at handling my
            husband&apos;s dietary needs; they never balked at our requests for

            6:30). Suhan fit in a trip to the Golden Bridge which I appreciated
            and made their day much longer. They both were always agreeable and
            worked very hard to attend to our needs and interests. Suhan made a
            point of getting photos of us on our tandem many times - a real
            treat for us because we usually travel alone with no one able to
            capture us on our bike. 2. Tong was a wonderful driver! Excellent
            driving skills and he really went out of his way to assist my
            husband... bringing baguettes, avocados and mangos in the mornings
            once he realized we&apos;d like to have that for breakfasts and
            dinners,. Preparing our rest stop snacks, always smiling and
            assisting with whatever needed to be done. Our second driver was
            also excellent. 3. All of the hotels and homestays, with the
            exception of the one we wrote you about during the trip, were
            excellent... probably better than I would have expected.
            Specifically the hotels in Hanoi, Hoi An and Saigon were really
            special. 4. The recommended stops along the way - the boat ride and
            caves, the pottery village, Khe Sanh, My Lai, the coconut/candy stop
            in the Mekong Delta and the sites in Hue, the Presidential Palace in
            Ho Chi Minh City... all were excellent. Our itinerary, which you
            adjusted to include my interest in some American war sites and our
            general interest to travel as much in small villages, away from the
            cities, was great. The overnight train ride was surprisingly
            comfortable ( We were lucky no other passengers joined our cabin,)
            Negatives 1. The most serious problem was our first guide&apos;s
            limited English. Although he was very attentive as I mentioned
            above, (and he gave GREAT foot massages!!!), his English skills were
            really sub par. We were very frustrated by this and stopped asking
            questions because he either often didn&apos;t understand our
            question or we couldn&apos;t understand his responses. We were quite
            surprised to have a guide with such limited English. Our second
            guide, Suhan, was fine and we were greatly relieved to be able to
            converse comfortably with him. 2. The restaurant that we stopped at
            in the Mekong Delta was a real tourist trap and had lousy food,
            expensive prices. They gave free or reduced meals to the guides
            which I suspect is why we stopped there but it was an unfortunate
            stop.. 3. Our guides couldn&apos;t keep up with us... perhaps more
            effort could be made to match riding ability between guides and
            riders. I didn&apos;t find it a huge problem because both guides
            were happy to let us go ahead, once they could see that we were
            accomplished, safe riders, but it did mean we lost riding time
            because we had to wait for them with the van rider several times.
            And they made more rest stops than we would have preferred,
            increasing our van vs riding time. Recommendations: 1. Teach the
            drivers to look for shade when stopping! The guides and drivers
            didn&apos;t mind the heat but for us, unaccustomed to 90+ degrees,
            we really wished they would always stop in the shade! 2. Have bike
            tools. Chain oil, chain tool, master links. My husband had inquired
            ahead to ensure they would be able to support what our tandem might
            need but they didn&apos;t even have chain oil or silicone lube
            (which they purchased for us along the road). 3.For safety purposes
            alone, the drivers and guide should be able to exchange GPS
            locations. One time we waited a good 15+ minutes while the guide
            tried to communicate to the driver where he should meet up with us.
            Once we had to briefly retrace steps because the driver was in a
            different place. I hope you find this helpful. Overall the trip met
            my desire to get to know, if only too briefly, post-American War
            Vietnam; to visit the sites known so well to Americans of my
            generation, enjoy some fabulous bike riding and be immersed in an
            entirely different culture. I am very glad we made the trip. Thank
            you, Rebecca Hutchinson

            mung Nam moi ! 😁 Thanks very much for the New Years email. We are
            having a fantastic time. We are really enjoying the cycling and the
            scenery. The service we have received so far has also been
            exceptional! Everyone has been very helpful, friendly and willing to
            help. We have felt very comfortable everywhere we have stayed. In
            particular Sarane has been fantastic - a really great tour leader!
            He has always kept us informed and worked hard to accomodate
            everyone’s needs. Chan has also been a great help driving and very
            patient. We only have a couple of days to go now, we head off to Hue
            tomorrow. It will be sad to say goodbye to everyone but we have had
            a really great time. Thanks for your help organising. Justin and Mia

            Lizzie: “Hello, I’m from Australia and I am here with my husband and
            we are doing an 11 day biking tour from Ho Chi Minh City to Angkor
            Wat in Cambodia. We have had five wonderful days cycling with our
            wonderful guide, Tien, and it has been a great experience. We have
            enjoyed it immensely. Lots of local villages we visited enjoying the
            food, some off road cycling, cycling through the paddy fields, small
            villages, it’s been a great experience. For anyone who wants to get
            off the tourist track and really immerse themselves in the
            Vietnamese culture.” Michael: “Hello, I’m Michael, I’m 60 years old
            and I come from Byron Bay in Australia. I’m here with Lizzie and we
            are enjoying the cycling trip. It’s very interesting, it’s a very
            good way to get close to the people and experience their everyday
            culture. We started off in the Mekong Delta, close to the sea and at
            a homestay, the homestay was very good, the people are very friendly
            and they taught us some Vietnamese cooking and now we are heading
            towards Cambodia, getting close to the border. I’m reasonably fit
            for 60 years old and this cycling is ok for me. It’s mostly flat,
            there are some bridges and that’s the only places you have to cycle
            hard. I use clips on my pedals but I would recommend that you have
            them very loose if you do this cycling because you don’t know when
            you are going to get off. You experience everything, like the rice
            fields, a bit of jungle, a bit of Vietnamese fruit trees everywhere.
            The local people are so wonderful and so friendly and you see so
            many children on the road saying hello all the time. It’s a very
            nice place and it’s about the culture and we love it here. We’re
            going to Cambodia and we will see how it goes there.

            hope this email finds you well. Patrick and I arrived in Hoi An
            yesterday afternoon at the end of our 3 day cycling trip from Nha
            Trang. I cannot say enough good things about our experience. So and
            Mr Chin were amazing. Both were incredibly helpful, attentive and
            kind. It was obvious how much work So put into the trip. He was able
            to answer all my questions about things we saw (and I had a lot of
            questions!) and the roads he took us on were excellent— both
            well-paved but also through a wide variety of scenery. The
            restaurants we ate at were also great. A few were local favorites
            and I’m thrilled we got the chance to try them. The first day we
            told So we wanted him to order for us because we trusted him to pick
            out local specialties. I recently posted on Facebook pictures of all
            the food we ate and many of my friends are jealous. I’ll definitely
            post an excellent review of So, Mr Chin and you (I’ve really
            appreciated your quick responses to my emails) on TripAdvisor once
            I’m back to my computer. We’re now very much looking forward to our
            bike trip in the Mekong. -Rachel

            through the Mekong delta. The driver was very good, super punctual
            and we would like to recommend him for further jobs. The bikes were
            really good and we are very satisfied. Just two little things could
            be improved. We had no bicycle stands. So at every stop (beaks or
            photo stops) we had to look for something we could lean the bikes
            against. And the repair package contained the wrong inner tubes.
            Luckily there was a repair shop not far away rom us when we needed
            it. Unfortunately I still have the air pump with me. What would you
            suggest to do with it? Should we send it to the shop with a courier
            or what would it cost if we pay for it? Best regards Heidi​

            We think Nat and Lam were the best. They went above and beyond , if

            Team in Cambodia were great too and they did good job looking after

            Alicevilla as I had quite a lot of bites from bedbugs overnight. We

            in the Mekong delta last week. The tour was well organized, with a
            lot of interesting places to see, small roads/paths with very little
            traffic and daily stages suitable for &quot;normal trained&quot;
            persons. The time we spent on the tour (three days, including the
            boat from Chau Doc to Phnom Penh), we think also was perfect for our
            travel. Probably will many tourist find two days on the bikes enough
            to explore the Mekong, and it is a good way to enter into Cambodja.
            Thank you for your service and for making this tour possible for us!

            traditional meal in old town. He is extremely conscientious guide
            and pays close attention to safety, particularly in traffic. He has
            a wonderful personality for a guide, because he is patient and
            attentive. He did his best to answer all our questions and meet our
            needs, even when it meant going out at night after dinner to replace
            a phone charging cable. We also appreciated our driver who found
            fresh fruit and delicious snacks and drove calmly in chaotic
            traffic. We would only like recommend that the driver and/ or guide
            have some additional training on 🚲 mechanics. Thank you for all of

            Subject: Feedback on tour 13 Jan - 27 Jan, 2018, HCMC to Hanoi Hi
            Ly, Berndt and I are not so good with Facebook and trip advisor
            stuff. We would prefer to write you an email with the feedback as
            some of our comments will be constructive criticisms for your
            business and we would not want that to go on to the public arena. We
            have had a fantastic time for the 15 days and you set us up with all
            necessary info with friendly professionalism - thankyou. We
            appreciated very much having a guide and driver the whole way. The
            cycling guides took us to places we would never have gone to on our
            own, and gave us opportunities to eat local village food we would
            never have dared tried - it was all an amazing experience. The
            overnight cruise to Halong Bay was a relaxing highlight after the
            cycling effort. The guides and driver were always prompt with
            starting times. Their help setting up the bikes etc was really
            appreciated. Hein, our driver for most of the trip, was superb, as
            we gained insight into the driving habits of the locals! We felt
            totally safe under his care. The guides on the whole were polite and
            caring. Austin, our first guide sometimes said we were going to do
            something, for example, see a coffee plantation, and then it
            didn&apos;t happen. This could have been a communication
            misunderstanding, but it was something I wanted to see. Sometimes we
            were told itineraries in the morning and then things happened
            differently. We understand our cycling ability and timing makes
            planning difficult, but sometimes the plans and timing were way out
            of kilter. On that note, we were surprised at how much traveling in
            the van there was. No problem with this, but we wonder that maybe
            the travel info could have the Total Distance from A - B stated, and
            within that, the approximate cycling distances dependent on ability
            and conditions. One comment about the last driver plus guide from
            the Hanoi hotel to the airport. We wondered if this guide was
            necessary? He seemed to have no interest in us (earplug in his ear,
            and a hoody over his head), and when we got to the airport he
            expected to take us to the check-in. We are perfectly capable of
            doing this ourselves (having already checked in on-line), so we
            wondered (after we felt obliged to pay him a tip), whether a guide
            needs to be there at all on the last day. The driver would have been
            enough. It would also have been helpful for all guides to have an
            overall map that we could refer to each day to get our bearings. One
            other suggestion for cyclists - to have a small towel handy in the
            van with a small bag with a change of clothes if you get wet.
            Sitting in a van for 2 hours drive in wet clothes is not much fun.
            (We were fine, as we did prepare for this) Food wise, this was
            amazing but way too much. This may be the Vietnamese way, but we
            also don&apos;t want to see food wasted. It seemed on some days that
            we were getting two main large meals, one at lunchtime, and another
            in the evening. If you would like any more specific feedback on any
            part of the tour, please ask. We will highly recommend your company
            to others, especially if some of the written daily notes and driving
            times are updated. Best wishes for more successful tours, Christine

            Dear Tran I want to thank you for all the work you did setting up
            our cycling adventure. All of the guides were great, the bikes and
            drivers were excellent. The hotels were mostly superb (the Chau Pho
            in Chau Doc was less than superb but still ok for a night). We
            simply had a wonderful and memorable time. My only feedback that you
            might consider in future is we found two emotionally charged tours,
            The Killing Fields and Prison 21 in one afternoon was too much. We
            passed on the second. Also the lunch we had at the Bopha Titanic
            Phnom Penh was simply the best meal on the trip. I&apos;ll certainly
            be posting positive reviews on Trip Advisor in the coming days. So

            in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines and Vietnam before this
            trip and I will say that this one was the best. Starting from my
            first contact, the rapid response from you, the payment process,
            assistance with hotel bookings all were faultless. The tour itself
            was great and Zang was the best. The bikes were very good condition
            and the van was very comfortable. I cannot find any fault. Keep
            doing exactly the way you are doung the tours. If you are ariund
            tomorrow we can meet. Regards Gerard

            country we are now back in Denmark - and at work again! On behalf of
            the whole family I would like to pass our sincere appreciation of
            all your efforts before and during our holiday. The planning and
            communication from your side has been excellent. This has been such
            an important factor for us to allow us to fully relax and enjoy.
            Thank you so much for that. You organised two great guides - both
            Tien for the first 11 days and then Zang (Giang) in Hanoi. Very
            likable personalities that took very good care of us, were flexible,
            knowledgable and fun company. The driver for the first 11 days, Ngia
            (I may have spelt his name wrong) was outstanding. He is a very,
            very safe driver and he is really service-minded. Make sure to pass
            our thank you and hugs to him and take good care of him. Thanks for

            and Khai as our driver. Both were very helpful and made the tour
            fun. Our driver did an excellent job of getting us and our
            belongings to and from the homestay - we felt totally safe despite
            heavy traffic. Our guide SaRane was helpful and knowledgeable,
            sharing his insights about the areas we rode through and looking
            after everything we needed. He was a delight to share the days with.
            He was most concerned that we have a good experience and was worried
            that the heavy rains would spoil it - but that was all part of the
            trip and the fun. Thank you again for your part in putting the trip

            Dear Quang, Sorry it took me so long to write to you. I was sick for
            2 weeks after our return to Germany and things have been a little
            crazy! Our bike tour with you was a definite highlight of our trip.
            We really enjoyed it and appreciated all the special things we
            experienced with you (especially the singing!) We did just the right
            amount of cycling – challenging for me, but doable. And I was proud
            that I didn’t have to take a ride in the van! The roads were off the
            beaten path and it was wonderful not only seeing so many different
            things and also learning about them from you. The restaurants you
            picked for us were great and we had nice stops along the way. The
            picnic we did for lunch on the third day was really fun. There is
            only one thing that I wondered about – we had originally booked a
            hotel outside of Cat Tien National Park for the first night. Then
            Vietnam Bike Tours wrote to me to say that because of flooding, it
            would not be possible to do the night drive to see the animals from
            outside the park. We would therefore have to book the lodge inside
            the park for 80 USD more. However, when we got there, everything was
            completely dry and it seems that there hadn’t been any major rain
            for weeks. So this did not make sense to me. Maybe you can pass that
            on to the management. Thank you so much for a wonderful bike tour
            (also our thanks to Tuan, the driver). I’ll also write a
            recommendation on Trip Advisor. Maybe we’ll see each other again

            both for putting together such a great trip to Viet Nam for us. We
            all felt we had a thorough insight into your country, culture,
            people, history, scenery, food and general way of life. And we got
            some exercise to boot! Your arrangements were all first class and
            the hotels were far better than we expected. But, maybe the most
            valuable part of our itinerary was having Phuc Le as our guide. From
            meeting us at the airport in Saigon to dropping us off at the
            airport in Hanoi he took absolutely great care of us. He quickly and
            accurately adapted the itinerary to our group and took a personal

            with Vietnam Bike Tours Hello Ly, How are you? We have just returned
            from our 4 day cycling tour of the Mekong Delta with Tien as our
            guide. We had a wonderful time and we both agree it is the best way
            to see your terrific country. We thought the tour was very well
            organised and the destinations were varied and unique to any other
            experience we&apos;ve had in Vietnam. We loved the accommodation,
            particularly our first night in the home stay. It was delightful.
            Our driver and guide (Tien). Our driver was so pleasant, always
            welcoming us with a smile and always on time. And Tien accommodated
            our needs with ease. He confidently answered our questions about the
            many fruits, vegetables and the way of life of the Vietnamese
            people. We also enjoyed getting to know him personally (we look
            forward to his baby pics on Facebook soon haha). We met up with
            another 4 day Mekong tour from Vietnam Bike Tours along the way, led
            by Jacki (not sure of the spelling). It would have been good to have
            toured alongside these people to provide more company and fun
            getting to know others. A few points for your information. We were
            overwhelmed by the amount of food. So nice and such wonderful food
            but we think there could be less so not as much goes to waste, but
            maybe that&apos;s just because we only eat small amounts. We are
            small people. Overall, we had a wonderful time and look forward to
            giving you a good review on trip advisor. Thank-you too Ly for your
            help in organising our trip. From Lucy. Sent from my iPhone

            Hi Kim, We are back home after a fantastic first cycling trip to
            Vietnam. Needless to add, this will not be the last! Thank you for
            organizing the bookings, visa & all other arrangements efficiently.
            We had a lovely experience cycling through the SaPa mountains. Ly
            Lao San made our trip enjoyable with his extensive cycling
            experience in the mountains, knowledge of the area and Vietnamese
            life in general. Tuan gave us a smooth ride in the van when the
            outside conditions became too cold to handle. All in all, I must
            compliment you for putting together an extremely friendly team on
            the ground all through our trip. Back in Hanoi there was a small
            confusion regarding the Hotel we were booked in on 18 Dec. We found
            it wasn&apos;t in Hotel Imperial after we drove up there but in
            Hotel Tirant. However, the stay at Hotel Tirant was indeed very
            pleasant. Thanks once again, we definitely hope to return to Vietnam
            for another cycling tour with you at the earliest opportunity.

            we both wanted to thank you for organising such a successful first

            we are already talking about bringing all of our 4 children back

            with Tiger we have spent a very relaxing break in Phu Quoc where we
            have had time to contemplate everything. There is very little that
            we would have changed so you really know what you are talking about!
            Perhaps the Cat Tien Park visit was not the highlight (the lodge
            itself seemed rather neglected) but the bike ride there and after we
            left the park was wonderful. Tiger, who was professionalism
            personified and extremely knowledgeable, staggered us with his
            knowledge of Vietnam, including the history and the agriculture. We
            also appreciate Hein&apos;s calmness and would love to have him
            drive for us again. We know you are due to have a new arrival

            questions about Vietnamese history and culture and he did a great
            job answering in English (not easy). We frequently engaged with

            &lt;sales@vietnambiketours.com&gt; Hello Ly, Good to hear from you!
            And congratulations on the coming new family member! Hope all is
            well. I was meant to write to you about my experience of the trip
            and give some feedback, but was very busy with work since I got
            back. I had a few free days in Saigon after the ride, but was tied
            up with other plans with family. I also was planning to visit your
            office to meet you, but did not have the opportunity either. First,
            I really like and appreciate Van Anh and Hien, the person who was
            driving the support van. They&apos;ve done everything to ensure my
            safety, the trip is enjoyable and were great companions throughout
            the trip. I learned so much more about Vietnam from them, even
            though I sort of growing up in the country. I never once felt unsafe
            during the whole trip. Van Anh is an impressive person and cyclist,
            I would love to ride with him again. Here is my thought about the
            ride: Except for the trail ride in Cat Tien National Park, a
            mountain bike is unnecessary. The rest of the ride was on paved road
            with some hills to climb, so a road bike is much more practical and
            enjoyable. A heavy mountain bike rides much slower, so increased
            time out on the road and restricted riding distance. And the hot
            summer weather could make the ride much less enjoyable for someone
            who was a cycling novice. My mountain bike fit me ok, except the
            handle bar was too wide so put a lot of stress on shoulder. I am
            also used to road bike, have not ridden a mountain bike for years.
            But I enjoyed the ride regardless, however will bring my road bike
            next time and only use your mountain bike for the trail ride. With a
            road bike, we perhaps can ride more if weather permits. The trail
            ride could be a bit longer, to 40-60km. I would not mind spending a
            day riding the trail then rest and continue road riding the next
            day. I am still kicking myself for forgetting to mount my GoPro
            camera on the bike for the trail ride. When we were riding, a large
            monkey ran across the trail right in front of us! That would be an
            image that I will show off and talk about for years to come! A note
            to the tour guide: remind everyone before the ride to set up their
            video camera on the bike if they have it. They may capture this kind
            of stunning, unforgettable images. I guess a majority of your
            clients are interested in travel tours with bike riding as
            secondary. But I recommend Vietnam Bike Tours to organize tours that
            are designed for cyclists and routes with different distance
            options. A seasoned cyclist would not be interested in only short
            rides and will look elsewhere for “real” cycling tours. I personally
            prefer bike tours that are designed more for cyclists, those that
            involve at least 60-100km a day of riding. There are many cyclists,
            both Vietnamese and American, in the US who would love to go on this
            kind of rides and willing to pay for one. I learned from Facebook
            that there are many cyclists in Vietnam who are doing just this,
            self-supported. Why don’t you plan one and see if there is any
            interest? Also make sure the ride is in the time of year that the
            weather is relatively nice, not so hot and humid? :-). Such as in
            Spring?. As for next year Saigon-Hoi An ride in March, I of course
            would love to go on this tour, now that I know what to expect. Two
            other friends of mine are also interested in the ride. A possible
            option is if the ride ends at Hoi An, the three of us could extend
            it to Hue afterward. Please send me the details when you have them
            (how many people signed up already, route plan and cost, when do I
            need to sign up). Last, thanks so much Ly, for setting this up for
            me! I really enjoyed the ride and will definitely join Vietnam Bike
            Tours on another future ride. Best Regards, Hai, USA

            although the Merila Hotel in Danang was very nice; it was far from
            the centre of town. We would have preferred being downtown (i.e.,
            near the beach walkway) so that we could have enjoyed the evening
            there rather than at the hotel. Once again, thank you very much.

            Dear Ngo Trong Huy We enjoyed the Cycling Tour with Vietnam Bike
            Tour a lot. We had the possibility to see and explore parts of
            Vietnam with beautiful landscape and scenery. The mix of sport and
            culture was perfect. There are some points where you can improve.
            Sometimes the guide put food in our plate which we didn&apos;t want
            to eat. I think each guest should decide by himself what he want to
            taste. Also one hotel wasn&apos;t very nice. The bathroom was

            Mekong delta on Mar 31-April 2, 2015 Hello Kim We had a fantastic
            trip with Tiger who showed us the beauty of the Mekong delta. Tiger
            took very good care of us and we loved the tour. Even if our saddle
            pain was uncomfortable..... But the bikes were fine. I would say a
            soft saddle for the ladies would be a good thing 😄 The home stays
            were lovely and the food very good. So a big thank you to Tiger for
            a great tour. And thank you to you for the organization. We will
            certainly recommend your company to friends and family. Kind regards

            Vietnam/Cambodia Bike Tour 25-31 January 2015 Our overall experience
            with Vietnam Bike Tours is ★★★★★ From the first e-mail contact with
            Mrs. Kim Anh, we experienced professional guidance in choosing what,
            when and how we wanted this adventure. Every step of the way was
            efficient, easy and in the end a real joy.The choice of hotels and
            restaurants was varied and more than acceptable. The final hotel in
            Angkor Wat was a genius stroke…a cut above our standard hotels, it
            was just what we needed at the end of our 11-day trip.Our only
            criticism is that the first bicycle for the female in our duo was
            simply too big. It was new, the seat adjustment was as good as it
            could be, but it was still too large as getting on and off the bike
            was always a hassle. She adjusted as well as possible, but were this
            not a problem, the trip would have been perfect.This problem could
            be solved by including a smaller model in the inventory of bikes.
            Our Vietnam guide for our January 25-31st bicycle trip through
            Vietnam, Mr. Tien Truong, was professional, personable,
            knowledgeable and caring. From the first encounter with us at the
            airport until our leaving at Chau Doc, he was a delight and made us
            comfortable. His handling of most every detail, from mid-morning
            snacks to hotel reservations/placement was outstanding. He was
            patient in finding a solution to a medical problem (which was
            eventually solved by his own home remedy), concerned about the
            quality of our food and drink, and tolerant and informative with our
            many questions. We have made a new friend and will recommend both
            Tien and the company to others. It was truly a great experience for
            us. Ruth Higgins

            Dear Quang, Although we spent a long time in the bus, We did not
            have time to say goodbye properly or to thank you properly. You were
            very professional, punctual, kind and considerate and you showed us
            a wonderful time in the Mekong Delta, it&apos;s people, it&apos;s
            jungle, it&apos;s rice fields and it&apos;s orchards. We wish you
            well in the future and although we never met your wife, your son or
            your mother, you spoke so fondly of them we will miss them too!!
            Keep singing my friend. Cam on nhieu!!! George and Grainne.

            through Vietnam, it was a unique experience. We enjoyed the trip,
            the beautiful nature, the friendly people and the delicious

            Tours Hello Ms. Ly, Don and I can’t begin to express how wonderful
            our experience was. The reviews will reflect that. I also offer to
            be available should any potential customer wish to contact me for
            questions or further information. I know that was helpful to me when
            I was planning our trip. All of the guides were incredible but we
            were particular fond of Mr. Tien and Mr. Haun. Having the same guide
            for the entire Vietnam experience seemed to work better for us.
            While the guides in Cambodia were good, the fact that we had so many
            different ones wasn’t preferable. They all did fine but the
            continuity seemed stronger in Vietnam. I assume this couldn’t be
            avoided. No complaints; just something of a personal preference. Mr.
            Tien is really quite exceptional. You should know that. He quickly
            understood our needs and seemed to provide us with a customized
            version of the trip. Not seeing other tourists, taking new routes to
            accommodate the road construction, choosing fruits that he knew we
            preferred and even wiping off the chopsticks with fresh limes before
            we used them… all attention to detail that was above and beyond our
            expectations. He also photographed our riding and sent us dozens of
            photos. It was so nice to have photos of both of us together. He is
            a treasure and an asset to your company. Thanks again for this
            amazing vacation. I am telling everyone I know about it and
            recommending it to all adventure seekers. Best regards, Jenn
            Sommermann

            shaw.ca Dear Mr Ngo We had a wonderful bike tour with Tien Feb 26 -
            March 1. He was an exceptional guide, very responsive to our needs
            and provided a very personal approach in engaging a number of the
            local people through the four days. These exchanges really enhanced
            our experience. We feel we better understand and appreciate Vietnam
            and her people. We were pleased with the accommodation, especially
            the food at our first home stay, and the bikes and the van support.
            As an aside, we did find the food portions very much more than we
            are used to. Although it is included in your notes, we regret we did
            not appreciate the need for smaller luggage until we were on the
            journey. Perhaps a note included with your booking emails will help
            other travellers realize that small is better. Thank you. Daniel &
            Maureen

            Mekong Delta Hi, I just wanted to give a little feedback on the 3
            day cycling tour we went on last weekend. The trip was wonderful and
            our guide, Mr. Gia (Jacky), was great. He showed up early to pick us
            up and was ready to go every morning well before we were done with
            breakfast. He was always upbeat and energetic as well as friendly
            and talkative with locals. Jacky made it clear that the schedule was
            flexible and was able to accommodate our requests. I really
            appreciated his guidance on this trip. One suggestion I&apos;d like
            to make is the addition of a small saddle bag or frame bag to the
            bicycles. Just something big enough to fit a mobile phone and wallet
            would be useful. For your information, my friend, Jane Pek, booked
            the trip. Thanks, Angela Yuan

            Concern, I would like to take this opportunity to let your company
            know that we were very pleased with our tour and our guide Mr Kim,
            who took us on a 4 day 3 night tour of the Mekong at the beginning
            of January. We found him to be very knowledgeable of the area and
            much of the route that we took was lovely. We found that he listened
            to our needs after encouraging us to reach our potential. He was a
            happy and interesting guide who was interested in taking us on an
            informative tour. Both of us will have recommend Mr Kim as a guide
            along with your tour company. We enjoyed the home stays that we
            stayed in during our tour and found the people that we dealt with
            along the way very welcoming. The tour was more diverse than we
            expected and we were very pleased with the tour and what we did and
            saw. We have both spoken highly and recommended our tour to others
            and have referred to it as one of the highlights of our trip to
            Vietnam. If you have any questions please email me. Regards Paula

            last week led by bike guide Mr. Hai. I would just like to let you
            know that Mr. Hai was absolutely fabulous with us. He was extremely
            knowledgeable about the area, vegetation, fruits, people, customs,
            and of course knew all the back roads like his inside pocket! He was
            very friendly, patient, and accommodating to our wishes (especially
            stopping and taking hundreds of pictures). He was/is a fantastic
            bike tour leader and I will recommend him to anyone who asks. I only
            have very high praise for his professionalism and skills as a bike
            tour leader. Thank you for our wonderful time in the Mekong Delta
            with Mr. Hai and Vietnam Bike Tours. Regards, Elisabeth Singh
