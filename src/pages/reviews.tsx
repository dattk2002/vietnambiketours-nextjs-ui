            I hope you had a great New Year’s. We are back to work and very
            busy.
            <br />
            First I’m checking to see how much we owe for the additional hotel
            in Bangkok and if I have any other charges I need to make good on.
            <br />
            We had a great vacation and haven’t had time to do our reviews but
            in Thailand Al and our driver were excellent which made our trip
            even better.
            <br />
            Please Thank Al again we don’t have any contact info for him
            <br />
            We our already thinking about next year Thanks Rob and Carmell

            <br />
            I would like to let you know we had 2 absolutely wonderful tours
            with Sarane in HCMC!
            <br />
            He was very knowledgeable, answered our questions, was extremely
            safe , kind and conscientious. We would highly recommend him to
            anyone for tours.

            Good afternoon Khanh Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful time we had cycling
            through the Mekong Delta, and how much we enjoyed having Mr. Trong
            as our guide.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you so much for accommodating us, and for being flexible as we
            figured out how to pay our bill!
            <br />
            <br />
            My parents have cycled many miles through many countries, and both
            agreed that this was their favorite trip. When we get settled back
            home I will be sure to write a proper review of our experience with
            Vietnam Bike Tours.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you again, and we hope to ride with you again some day.
            <br />
            <br />
            Regards,
            <br />

            Hey Tom,
            <br />
            Were just about over our jet lag so I thought Id send some feedback
            on our trip from Luang prabang to Hanoi.
            <br />
            First of all, I&apos; d like to say It was a great adventure. We
            definitely got off the tourist track and saw the country and the
            people from a different angle.
            <br />
            <br />
            I think the first leg, in Laos was my favorite. The combination of
            backroads, wonderful people, good foods and great guides made the
            long dusty days enjoyable, Mr Xee Xong was super caring and
            attentive to our needs and desires. he kept great track of everyone
            and made sure we got good lodging, arranged dinners and explained
            the routes to us as best he could.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whoever worked out the boat ride/shuttle/boa tride on the Nam Ou was
            genius because none of us relished the alternative.
            <br />
            Mr So did a good job as backup guide and mechanic. As you know,
            these are not top of the line bikes, so keeping the derailleurs
            operating in the dusty conditions was a challenge. The drivers were
            a great support in many ways..
            <br />
            <br />
            Once we got into Vietnam we had to adjust to the new guide and
            driver. It was difficult to go from 2 guides and 2 drivers to one
            guide and one driver. Mr Quinn took some getting used to as well. I
            appreciate his knowledge of the many bike routes along the way. They
            took us off the main track through some wonderful country. One
            trouble, however was his inability or unwillingness to communicate
            the intended route for the day. Since we were familiar with the
            itinerary we could let him know what we felt up for that day. When
            he changed the route for the day without explanation, which was most
            days, we felt a bit at his mercy. This bothered some more than
            others. I do think that on a tour like this, a brief description of
            the day ahead is important information for the client to have.
            <br />
            <br />
            The lodging was mostly good to great, but some of those mega resorts
            like in Dien Bien Foo and Cuc Phong were a little much. It was nice
            to have the last few days to just relax on the cruise in Halong Bay.
            <br />
            <br />
            So, I think this tour was wonderful. We would have enjoyed knowing
            ahead that the itinerary is subject to change and that Mileages and
            elevations may differ from those on the itinerary.
            <br />
            <br />
            Choosing guides, like Mr Xee that can communicate the plan and the
            options available to us would be much more professional. Also, a
            page on the website with info on visas, changing money, suggested
            immunizations, etc would simplify preparation.
            <br />
            <br />
            You said that you don&apos; t get much feed back, so here you go. I
            hope it is useful. We&apos; d love to return someday for another
            tour.
            <br />

            subject:Review of our trip March, 2019
            <br />
            <br />
            Please forward this review to Li
            <br />
            <br />
            I just completed a Trip Advisor review, giving an overall rating of
            4 for our trip. I thought more complete feedback might be helpful to
            you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Positives:
            <br />
            1. Both of our guides tried very hard to make our trip enjoyable.
            They were very good at handling my husband&apos; s dietary needs;
            they never balked at our requests for very early morning starts to
            avoid the heat (once 5:30am, often 6 or 6:30). Suhan fit in a trip
            to the Golden Bridge which I appreciated and made their day much
            longer. They both were always agreeable and worked very hard to
            attend to our needs and interests. Suhan made a point of getting
            photos of us on our tandem many times - a real treat for us because
            we usually travel alone with no one able to capture us on our bike.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Tong was a wonderful driver! Excellent driving skills and he
            really went out of his way to assist my husband... bringing
            baguettes, avocados and mangos in the mornings once he realized
            we&apos; d like to have that for breakfasts and dinners,. Preparing
            our rest stop snacks, always smiling and assisting with whatever
            needed to be done. Our second driver was also excellent.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. All of the hotels and homestays, with the exception of the one we
            wrote you about during the trip, were excellent... probably better
            than I would have expected. Specifically the hotels in Hanoi, Hoi An
            and Saigon were really special.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. The recommended stops along the way - the boat ride and caves,
            the pottery village, Khe Sanh, My Lai, the coconut/candy stop in the
            Mekong Delta and the sites in Hue, the Presidential Palace in Ho Chi
            Minh City... all were excellent. Our itinerary, which you adjusted
            to include my interest in some American war sites and our general
            interest to travel as much in small villages, away from the cities,
            was great. The overnight train ride was surprisingly comfortable (
            We were lucky no other passengers joined our cabin,)
            <br />
            <br />
            Negatives
            <br />
            1. The most serious problem was our first guide&apos; s limited
            English. Although he was very attentive as I mentioned above, (and
            he gave GREAT foot massages!!!), his English skills were really sub
            par. We were very frustrated by this and stopped asking questions
            because he either often didn&apos; t understand our question or we
            couldn&apos; t understand his responses. We were quite surprised to
            have a guide with such limited English. Our second guide, Suhan, was
            fine and we were greatly relieved to be able to converse comfortably
            with him.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. The restaurant that we stopped at in the Mekong Delta was a real
            tourist trap and had lousy food, expensive prices. They gave free or
            reduced meals to the guides which I suspect is why we stopped there
            but it was an unfortunate stop..
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Our guides couldn&apos; t keep up with us... perhaps more effort
            could be made to match riding ability between guides and riders. I
            didn&apos; t find it a huge problem because both guides were happy
            to let us go ahead, once they could see that we were accomplished,
            safe riders, but it did mean we lost riding time because we had to
            wait for them with the van rider several times. And they made more
            rest stops than we would have preferred, increasing our van vs
            riding time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Recommendations:
            <br />
            1. Teach the drivers to look for shade when stopping! The guides and
            drivers didn&apos; t mind the heat but for us, unaccustomed to 90+
            degrees, we really wished they would always stop in the shade!
            <br />
            2. Have bike tools. Chain oil, chain tool, master links. My husband
            had inquired ahead to ensure they would be able to support what our
            tandem might need but they didn&apos; t even have chain oil or
            silicone lube (which they purchased for us along the road).
            <br />
            3.For safety purposes alone, the drivers and guide should be able to
            exchange GPS locations. One time we waited a good 15+ minutes while
            the guide tried to communicate to the driver where he should meet up
            with us. Once we had to briefly retrace steps because the driver was
            in a different place.
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope you find this helpful. Overall the trip met my desire to get
            to know, if only too briefly, post-American War Vietnam; to visit
            the sites known so well to Americans of my generation, enjoy some
            fabulous bike riding and be immersed in an entirely different
            culture. I am very glad we made the trip.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you,
            <br />

            Chuc mung Nam moi ! 😁
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks very much for the New Years email. We are having a fantastic
            time. We are really enjoying the cycling and the scenery.
            <br />
            <br />
            The service we have received so far has also been exceptional!
            Everyone has been very helpful, friendly and willing to help. We
            have felt very comfortable everywhere we have stayed.
            <br />
            <br />
            In particular Sarane has been fantastic - a really great tour
            leader! He has always kept us informed and worked hard to accomodate
            everyone’s needs. Chan has also been a great help driving and very
            patient.
            <br />
            <br />
            We only have a couple of days to go now, we head off to Hue
            tomorrow. It will be sad to say goodbye to everyone but we have had
            a really great time.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for your help organising.

            Lizzie: “Hello, I’m from Australia and I am here with my husband and
            we are doing an 11 day biking tour from Ho Chi Minh City to Angkor
            Wat in Cambodia. We have had five wonderful days cycling with our
            wonderful guide, Tien, and it has been a great experience. We have
            enjoyed it immensely. Lots of local villages we visited enjoying the
            food, some off road cycling, cycling through the paddy fields, small
            villages, it’s been a great experience. For anyone who wants to get
            off the tourist track and really immerse themselves in the
            Vietnamese culture.”
            <br />
            <br />
            Michael: “Hello, I’m Michael, I’m 60 years old and I come from Byron
            Bay in Australia. I’m here with Lizzie and we are enjoying the
            cycling trip. It’s very interesting, it’s a very good way to get
            close to the people and experience their everyday culture. We
            started off in the Mekong Delta, close to the sea and at a homestay,
            the homestay was very good, the people are very friendly and they
            taught us some Vietnamese cooking and now we are heading towards
            Cambodia, getting close to the border. I’m reasonably fit for 60
            years old and this cycling is ok for me. It’s mostly flat, there are
            some bridges and that’s the only places you have to cycle hard. I
            use clips on my pedals but I would recommend that you have them very
            loose if you do this cycling because you don’t know when you are
            going to get off. You experience everything, like the rice fields, a
            bit of jungle, a bit of Vietnamese fruit trees everywhere. The local
            people are so wonderful and so friendly and you see so many children
            on the road saying hello all the time. It’s a very nice place and
            it’s about the culture and we love it here. We’re going to Cambodia
            and we will see how it goes there.

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope this email finds you well. Patrick and I arrived in Hoi An
            yesterday afternoon at the end of our 3 day cycling trip from Nha
            Trang. I cannot say enough good things about our experience. So and
            Mr Chin were amazing. Both were incredibly helpful, attentive and
            kind. It was obvious how much work So put into the trip. He was able
            to answer all my questions about things we saw (and I had a lot of
            questions!) and the roads he took us on were excellent— both
            well-paved but also through a wide variety of scenery. The
            restaurants we ate at were also great. A few were local favorites
            and I’m thrilled we got the chance to try them. The first day we
            told So we wanted him to order for us because we trusted him to pick
            out local specialties. I recently posted on Facebook pictures of all
            the food we ate and many of my friends are jealous.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’ll definitely post an excellent review of So, Mr Chin and you
            (I’ve really appreciated your quick responses to my emails) on
            TripAdvisor once I’m back to my computer.
            <br />
            <br />
            We’re now very much looking forward to our bike trip in the Mekong.

            Our last visit to Vietnam was our fourth trip to Vietnam. Our
            expectations were very high in what we wanted to do and what we
            wanted to see you. You and Vietnam bike tour came through on every
            level including our ground transportation hotels and bicycles and
            super great guides who are willing to work with us to make it a
            perfect vacation Carmell and I would like to thank you very much for
            your hard work and patience with us during creating where and what
            we were going to do. We do plan on returning again before Christmas
            next year for another holiday with you and your team. Also when I
            make posts on Facebook about how good our guides and drivers are it
            is true and I mean what I say about how good they are and how they
            treat us which is part of our experience so to say Phuc Lai and Art
            and his driver were exceptional-thanks Rob and Carmell

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            we had a wunderful tour through the Mekong delta. The driver was
            very good, super punctual and we would like to recommend him for
            further jobs.
            <br />
            <br />
            The bikes were really good and we are very satisfied. Just two
            little things could be improved. We had no bicycle stands. So at
            every stop (beaks or photo stops) we had to look for something we
            could lean the bikes against. And the repair package contained the
            wrong inner tubes. Luckily there was a repair shop not far away rom
            us when we needed it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately I still have the air pump with me. What would you
            suggest to do with it? Should we send it to the shop with a courier
            or what would it cost if we pay for it?
            <br />
            <br />
            Best regards
            <br />

            Hi Ly,
            <br />
            This is just a little note to say thank you so much .
            <br />
            We had amazing time cycling around last few weeks with Vietnam Bike
            tours.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had great service from the teams.
            <br />
            We think Nat and Lam were the best. They went above and beyond , if
            we do another cycling tour we would love to have them as our guides.
            <br />
            <br />
            Team in Cambodia were great too and they did good job looking after
            us.
            <br />
            Mostly all hotels you selected for us were good apart from
            Alicevilla as I had quite a lot of bites from bedbugs overnight.
            <br />
            We would love to do another cycling holiday with your company in
            future for sure ( thinking of cycling in Myanmar and From Saigon to
            Hanoi sometime) .
            <br />

            <br />

            <br />
            I had the most wonderful bike tour with Mr Quang and your
            experienced and kind driver!
            <br />
            I was more than satisfied - we saw so much - had great fun and were
            so well taken care of. I wish to extend my deepest and most
            respectful thank you to Quang for such a pleasurable and exciting
            tour.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mr Quang is so kind, respectful, well organized, skilled and
            professional!
            <br />
            I will certainly recommend his tours to anybody interested in biking
            in the Mekong area.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank You for your hospitality in Vietnam and hope to see you one

            Dear ms. Ly
            <br />
            We just want to inform you that we had a very nice tour with mr.
            Tien in the Mekong delta last week. The tour was well organized,
            with a lot of interesting places to see, small roads/paths with very
            little traffic and daily stages suitable for &quot;normal
            trained&quot; persons. The time we spent on the tour (three days,
            including the boat from Chau Doc to Phnom Penh), we think also was
            perfect for our travel. Probably will many tourist find two days on
            the bikes enough to explore the Mekong, and it is a good way to
            enter into Cambodja.
            <br />
            Thank you for your service and for making this tour possible for us!
            <br />
            Best regards

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            Everything went as expected and Jackie worked Hard to keep us on
            schedule. We made it to the hotel by 6 PM, and then enjoyed a
            traditional meal in old town. He is extremely conscientious guide
            and pays close attention to safety, particularly in traffic. He has
            a wonderful personality for a guide, because he is patient and
            attentive. He did his best to answer all our questions and meet our
            needs, even when it meant going out at night after dinner to replace
            a phone charging cable.
            <br />
            <br />
            We also appreciated our driver who found fresh fruit and delicious
            snacks and drove calmly in chaotic traffic.
            <br />
            <br />
            We would only like recommend that the driver and/ or guide have some
            additional training on 🚲 mechanics.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for all of your help. We had a wonderful trip. I will
            definitely recommend your services to friends.
            <br />

            <br />
            Hi Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            Berndt and I are not so good with Facebook and trip advisor stuff.
            We would prefer to write you an email with the feedback as some of
            our comments will be constructive criticisms for your business and
            we would not want that to go on to the public arena.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have had a fantastic time for the 15 days and you set us up with
            all necessary info with friendly professionalism - thankyou.
            <br />
            <br />
            We appreciated very much having a guide and driver the whole way.
            The cycling guides took us to places we would never have gone to on
            our own, and gave us opportunities to eat local village food we
            would never have dared tried - it was all an amazing experience. The
            overnight cruise to Halong Bay was a relaxing highlight after the
            cycling effort.
            <br />
            <br />
            The guides and driver were always prompt with starting times. Their
            help setting up the bikes etc was really appreciated. Hein, our
            driver for most of the trip, was superb, as we gained insight into
            the driving habits of the locals! We felt totally safe under his
            care.
            <br />
            <br />
            The guides on the whole were polite and caring. Austin, our first
            guide sometimes said we were going to do something, for example, see
            a coffee plantation, and then it didn&apos; t happen. This could
            have been a communication misunderstanding, but it was something I
            wanted to see. Sometimes we were told itineraries in the morning and
            then things happened differently. We understand our cycling ability
            and timing makes planning difficult, but sometimes the plans and
            timing were way out of kilter.
            <br />
            <br />
            On that note, we were surprised at how much traveling in the van
            there was. No problem with this, but we wonder that maybe the travel
            info could have the Total Distance from A - B stated, and within
            that, the approximate cycling distances dependent on ability and
            conditions.
            <br />
            <br />
            One comment about the last driver plus guide from the Hanoi hotel to
            the airport. We wondered if this guide was necessary? He seemed to
            have no interest in us (earplug in his ear, and a hoody over his
            head), and when we got to the airport he expected to take us to the
            check-in. We are perfectly capable of doing this ourselves (having
            already checked in on-line), so we wondered (after we felt obliged
            to pay him a tip), whether a guide needs to be there at all on the
            last day. The driver would have been enough.
            <br />
            <br />
            It would also have been helpful for all guides to have an overall
            map that we could refer to each day to get our bearings.
            <br />
            <br />
            One other suggestion for cyclists - to have a small towel handy in
            the van with a small bag with a change of clothes if you get wet.
            Sitting in a van for 2 hours drive in wet clothes is not much fun.
            (We were fine, as we did prepare for this)
            <br />
            <br />
            Food wise, this was amazing but way too much. This may be the
            Vietnamese way, but we also don&apos; t want to see food wasted. It
            seemed on some days that we were getting two main large meals, one
            at lunchtime, and another in the evening.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you would like any more specific feedback on any part of the
            tour, please ask.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will highly recommend your company to others, especially if some
            of the written daily notes and driving times are updated.
            <br />
            <br />
            Best wishes for more successful tours,
            <br />

            Ms. Ly,
            <br />
            Our tour with Mr. Hoang was fantastic. He was one of the best tour
            guides that we ever had.
            <br />
            Overall it was just a great experience.

            Hi LY
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks so much to you and Tien for a wonderful experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tien was an absolute gem, always helpful, setting a great relaxing
            pace up front and always attentive for our needs. The journey
            through the villages and the wonderful warm greetings of the
            villagers will remain with us always. We also really enjoyed the
            home stay and cooking as well.
            <br />
            <br />
            Wishing you all the very best to you both!!
            <br />
            <br />
            Best
            <br />
            John and family!

            On the way home now, and want to let you know I had a GREAT time!
            Thanks for helping me get this together. The Mekong delta portion
            was just grand and you were spot on to nudge me to take this. I
            report that 65 km of cycling on those paths is a good day of
            cycling! All the arrangements were workable, both guides were good
            guys and I don’t have any complaints at all.

            Hi Ly,

            <br />
            Thank you for the tour at the weekend it was great fun and the
            perfect way to see the countryside on a Saturday morning. Mr Sarane
            was excellent and I have just left a review on Tripadisor. He did
            take lots of photos and said he would send them but i haven&apos; t
            received anything yet. Can you check with him, I may have missed
            something though.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks

            Dear Tran
            <br />
            <br />
            I want to thank you for all the work you did setting up our cycling
            adventure.
            <br />
            All of the guides were great, the bikes and drivers were excellent.
            The hotels
            <br />
            were mostly superb (the Chau Pho in Chau Doc was less than superb
            but still ok for a night). We simply had a wonderful and memorable
            time.
            <br />
            <br />
            My only feedback that you might consider in future is we found two
            emotionally charged tours, The Killing Fields and Prison 21 in one
            afternoon was too much. We passed on the second.
            <br />
            <br />
            Also the lunch we had at the Bopha Titanic Phnom Penh was simply the
            best meal on the trip.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&apos; ll certainly be posting positive reviews on Trip Advisor in
            the coming days.
            <br />
            <br />
            So thanks to everyone at Vietnam Bike Tours
            <br />

            Hi,
            <br />
            Thank you very much for your services.
            <br />
            I have done bicycle tours in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Philippines
            and Vietnam before this trip and I will say that this one was the
            best.
            <br />
            Starting from my first contact, the rapid response from you, the
            payment process, assistance with hotel bookings all were faultless.
            <br />
            The tour itself was great and Zang was the best. The bikes were very
            good condition and the van was very comfortable. I cannot find any
            fault. Keep doing exactly the way you are doung the tours.
            <br />
            If you are ariund tomorrow we can meet.
            <br />
            Regards
            <br />

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            After a wonderful holiday in your beautiful country we are now back
            in Denmark - and at work again!
            <br />
            <br />
            On behalf of the whole family I would like to pass our sincere
            appreciation of all your efforts before and during our holiday. The
            planning and communication from your side has been excellent. This
            has been such an important factor for us to allow us to fully relax
            and enjoy. Thank you so much for that.
            <br />
            <br />
            You organised two great guides - both Tien for the first 11 days and
            then Zang (Giang) in Hanoi. Very likable personalities that took
            very good care of us, were flexible, knowledgable and fun company.
            <br />
            <br />
            The driver for the first 11 days, Ngia (I may have spelt his name
            wrong) was outstanding. He is a very, very safe driver and he is
            really service-minded. Make sure to pass our thank you and hugs to
            him and take good care of him.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for everything - and we hope to be back again some day. All
            the best to you and the company.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kind Regards,

            <br />
            Just wanting to say how much we enjoyed the bike tour today.
            <br />
            <br />
            What an incredible countryside it is! The views were just
            incredible! And Mr San was great.
            <br />
            <br />
            We were also really happy with the bikes (and good disc brakes they
            had which were really needed going down some of those hills).
            <br />
            <br />
            The family had an awesome day (even though our 12 year old girl
            struggled at times keeping up 😬).
            <br />
            <br />
            We will recommend your company to other families we know that are
            heading to Vietnam 🇻🇳
            <br />
            <br />

            We enjoyed getting to know him, and he was very easy to talk to. The
            <br />
            cycling route was nice and pretty for a half day. He also was very

            I am hugely impressed by your company, by Ly and her organisation
            and by Phuc as our guide. Ly organised the trip with my daughter
            brilliantly. We had very good drivers, excellent bikes and safety
            helmets and exactly the trip we wanted. Phuc”s guiding was superb :
            everything we wanted was catered for and in many cases organised in
            advance of us. He was very safety conscious and was extremely good
            company.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would like to thank all of you and hope you will continue to
            prosper.

            Hello
            <br />
            I&apos; d like to let you know how very much Dan and I enjoyed our
            cycling trip
            <br />
            on November 24-25 with Thach SaRane as our guide and Khai as our
            driver. Both were very helpful and made the tour fun. Our driver did
            an excellent job of getting us and our belongings to and from the
            homestay - we felt totally safe despite heavy traffic.
            <br />
            Our guide SaRane was helpful and knowledgeable, sharing his insights
            about the areas we rode through and looking after everything we
            needed. He was a delight to share the days with. He was most
            concerned that we have a good experience and was worried that the
            heavy rains would spoil it - but that was all part of the trip and
            the fun.
            <br />
            Thank you again for your part in putting the trip together for us.
            <br />
            <br />
            Best wishes

            Hi Tran Thanh
            <br />
            <br />
            We had a fantastic time on our 5 day cycling holiday, greatly helped
            by the good organisation, and by our guide TIger, who was superb in
            providing us with lots of information and leading us to some very
            interesting locations. The hotels were all of a good standard and we
            appreciated the drink stops etc. and the support from our driver
            Kim, making it a very enjoyable experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will definitely recommend your cycling tour to any of our friends
            coming to Vietnam.
            <br />

            Dear Quang,
            <br />
            <br />
            Sorry it took me so long to write to you. I was sick for 2 weeks
            after our return to Germany and things have been a little crazy!
            <br />
            <br />
            Our bike tour with you was a definite highlight of our trip. We
            really enjoyed it and appreciated all the special things we
            experienced with you (especially the singing!) We did just the right
            amount of cycling – challenging for me, but doable. And I was proud
            that I didn’t have to take a ride in the van! The roads were off the
            beaten path and it was wonderful not only seeing so many different
            things and also learning about them from you. The restaurants you
            picked for us were great and we had nice stops along the way. The
            picnic we did for lunch on the third day was really fun.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is only one thing that I wondered about – we had originally
            booked a hotel outside of Cat Tien National Park for the first
            night. Then Vietnam Bike Tours wrote to me to say that because of
            flooding, it would not be possible to do the night drive to see the
            animals from outside the park. We would therefore have to book the
            lodge inside the park for 80 USD more. However, when we got there,
            everything was completely dry and it seems that there hadn’t been
            any major rain for weeks. So this did not make sense to me. Maybe
            you can pass that on to the management.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you so much for a wonderful bike tour (also our thanks to
            Tuan, the driver). I’ll also write a recommendation on Trip Advisor.
            Maybe we’ll see each other again some day!
            <br />
            <br />

            Just finished our cycling Mekong holiday. It was an excellent family
            adventure. Our guide Austin and driver Lye were very caring,
            entertaining and a great company.
            <br />
            Austin has mentioned that you have some evening motorbike food tours
            in Saigon. Can you please advise what are the options. We are
            thinking of 1 April, if possible.

            Tien. He showed us so many very interesting routes, side trip mini
            tours and great variety of meals. He taught us so much. He is an

            Hello Tran,
            <br />
            Thank you so much for organising our bike tour with Quang. He was an
            outstanding guide and we were very happy to have him as our guide.
            Our bus driver Fop was very good also and we were well looked after
            by both of them. The bike ride was fabulous and we loved meeting a
            lot of the local people and riding through their villages. It was a
            fabulous experience for my husband and I. We were very happy also
            with the accommodation each night, first at the Mekong River Resort
            and then the Victoria Resort. They were exceptional and very
            pleasant after a day riding the bikes. The bikes also were of a
            great standard. Thank you also for arranging to collect us from the
            Airport after we missed our connecting flight due to delay, that
            definitely made things easier. Would you please send me a receipt
            for the USD $35 for the airport pickup. I may be able to claim this
            on insurance.
            <br />
            Thank you again and I will definitely recommend your company and
            also Quang, our guide and Fop, driver.
            <br />
            I will do a comment on trip advisor soon.

            Dear Ms Kim and Huy,
            <br />
            I just wanted to thank you both for putting together such a great
            trip to
            <br />
            Viet Nam for us. We all felt we had a thorough insight into your
            country,
            <br />
            culture, people, history, scenery, food and general way of life. And
            <br />
            we got some exercise to boot! Your arrangements were all first class
            <br />
            and the hotels were far better than we expected.
            <br />
            But, maybe the most valuable part of our itinerary was having Phuc
            Le as our guide. From meeting us at the airport in Saigon to
            dropping us off at the airport in Hanoi he took absolutely great
            care of us. He quickly and accurately adapted the itinerary to our
            group and took a personal interest in and became a friend of each of
            us. He was always prompt, told great and insightful stories and
            filled our days completely with just the right amount of activity.
            And let me add that he is quite the witty fellow as well. It was a
            sad moment when we had to say good-bye to him.
            <br />
            Thanks again for everything. We will highly recommend your company
            and Phuc to everyone we can. I am not on Facebook and do not have an
            email address for Phuc, so would you please forward this message to
            him.

            <br />
            <br />
            We have just returned from our 4 day cycling tour of the Mekong
            Delta with Tien as our guide. We had a wonderful time and we both
            agree it is the best way to see your terrific country. We thought
            the tour was very well organised and the destinations were varied
            and unique to any other experience we&apos; ve had in Vietnam. We
            loved the accommodation, particularly our first night in the home
            stay. It was delightful.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our driver and guide (Tien). Our driver was so pleasant, always
            welcoming us with a smile and always on time. And Tien accommodated
            our needs with ease. He confidently answered our questions about the
            many fruits, vegetables and the way of life of the Vietnamese
            people. We also enjoyed getting to know him personally (we look
            forward to his baby pics on Facebook soon haha).
            <br />
            <br />
            We met up with another 4 day Mekong tour from Vietnam Bike Tours
            along the way, led by Jacki (not sure of the spelling). It would
            have been good to have toured alongside these people to provide more
            company and fun getting to know others.
            <br />
            <br />
            A few points for your information. We were overwhelmed by the amount
            of food. So nice and such wonderful food but we think there could be
            less so not as much goes to waste, but maybe that&apos; s just
            because we only eat small amounts. We are small people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Overall, we had a wonderful time and look forward to giving you a
            good review on trip advisor. Thank-you too Ly for your help in
            organising our trip.

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            Wanted to let you know that we had a good day cycling and really
            enjoyed ourselves. Thank you for organising the tour. Our guide was
            friendly, informative and knowledgeable. The route was also a nice
            leisure ride.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hope to get the opportunity to visit Vietnam again soon, and perhaps
            plan for a longer and more adventurous ride!
            <br />

            Hi Kim,
            <br />
            <br />
            We are back home after a fantastic first cycling trip to Vietnam.
            Needless
            <br />
            to add, this will not be the last!
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for organizing the bookings, visa & all other arrangements
            efficiently.
            <br />
            We had a lovely experience cycling through the SaPa mountains.
            <br />
            Ly Lao San made our trip enjoyable with his extensive cycling
            experience in the mountains, knowledge of the area and Vietnamese
            life in general.
            <br />
            Tuan gave us a smooth ride in the van when the outside conditions
            became too cold to handle. All in all, I must compliment you for
            putting together an
            <br />
            extremely friendly team on the ground all through our trip.
            <br />
            <br />
            Back in Hanoi there was a small confusion regarding the Hotel we
            were booked in on 18 Dec. We found it wasn&apos; t in Hotel Imperial
            after we drove up
            <br />
            there but in Hotel Tirant. However, the stay at Hotel Tirant was
            indeed very pleasant.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks once again, we definitely hope to return to Vietnam for
            another cycling tour with you at the earliest opportunity.

            Kim,
            <br />
            <br />
            We are on our way home to a cold London and we both wanted to thank
            you for organising such a successful first visit to Vietnam.
            Let&apos; s hope there will be many more! In fact, we are already
            talking about bringing all of our 4 children back this time next
            year for a brief visit.
            <br />
            <br />
            After such a frantic few days with Tiger we have spent a very
            relaxing break in Phu Quoc where we have had time to contemplate
            everything. There is very little that we would have changed so you
            really know what you are talking about! Perhaps the Cat Tien Park
            visit was not the highlight (the lodge itself seemed rather
            neglected) but the bike ride there and after we left the park was
            wonderful. Tiger, who was professionalism personified and extremely
            knowledgeable, staggered us with his knowledge of Vietnam, including
            the history and the agriculture. We also appreciate Hein&apos; s
            calmness and would love to have him drive for us again.
            <br />
            <br />
            We know you are due to have a new arrival imminently and we wanted
            to add our good wishes and hope that all goes well.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many, many thanks once again for all your marvellous organisation
            that went absolutely perfectly.
            <br />
            <br />
            Kind regards,
            <br />

            Hello Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            I wanted to follow up with a note about our trip to the
            Mekong....thanks so much for changing things around for us and
            apologies for the confusion. You did a great job accommodating us.
            <br />
            <br />
            Quang was simply fantastic!!!
            <br />
            <br />
            He went out of his way to make sure that we were happy with our
            trip. He did a great job of explaining where we were, how the locals
            lived (which is why we wanted to go on a trip like this), and
            introducing us to life in the delta. He continually made sure the
            bikes fit and nothing was broken and that we comfortable and not too
            rushed.
            <br />
            <br />
            We had many many questions about Vietnamese history and culture and
            he did a great job answering in English (not easy). We frequently
            engaged with locals and he is obviously well regarded and liked.
            Quite simply, HE made our trip fantastic and and we hope to plan
            something again.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks again and special hello and good bye to Quang from his two
            American women friends...we had a great time!

            <br />
            We have spent the last few days assembling some of our photos from
            our cycle trip in the Mekong, including the great photos you
            supplied us!
            <br />
            <br />
            It was such a wonderful trip! Thank you so much for guiding us so
            knowledgeably, and for being prepared to adapt where we went and
            what we did to our family needs. We felt very well looked after by
            you and our driver, and we loved the parts of the countryside and
            sights that you took us to.
            <br />
            <br />
            We really enjoyed the food at the local restaurants you took us to,
            and the home stays.
            <br />
            <br />
            We really liked how much you knew about your country and the places
            we went, it made the whole experience very rich and rewarding, and
            it certainly had a big impression on our children who got to see
            people living very differently to how they do in New Zealand with
            its much cooler climate, and how your country operates and its
            history.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will be recommending your company to our friends, and if we
            return to Vietnam for more cycling in the future we will be getting
            in touch!
            <br />

            Hi,
            <br />
            Just wanted to say we had a fantastic time on this tour. While the
            tour, the guide and the route was great, slightly disappointed with
            the lunch. It was setup in a hut with muddy, wet and smelly outside,
            felt a bit like in the middle of rice paddy. Food was very basic and
            not as tasteful as I have come to know Vietnamese food.
            <br />
            By the way, could you please email us the photos taken by Mr. Tien.
            Regards. Sumen

            Thankyou for a brilliant Mekong tour.
            <br />
            My mum and her three friends loved the experiences and could not
            sing Tien enough praises. :)
            <br />
            Very amazing effort with what felt like private tracks and lots of
            great facts and information along the way.
            <br />
            They returned and said that i need to take a weekend cycling the
            mekong with Tien.
            <br />
            <br />
            Out of interest, what cost would that be? I would like to leave
            early on Saturday morning and return on the Sunday night.
            <br />
            I would like to cycle for approx 60 kms each day, see the floating
            markets, but not too interested in any other artisans along the way.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many Thanks, Jasmine

            Andrew,
            <br />
            <br />
            We both had a great time on the bike tour. The 50 km were a bit
            harsh due to the heat and humidity, I think it was over 35 degrees
            and 90% humidity, but the sites were wonderful and the guide was
            great.
            <br />
            <br />
            One thing I really liked (and I’ve done this a lot) is that our
            guide was the one that picked us up at the airport, took us on the
            trip the next day, and got us to the airport on the third day. The
            continuity was very nice.
            <br />
            <br />
            Next question;
            <br />
            <br />
            Can we do the same thing for Ho Chi Minh on Sept 20th?

            Good morning.
            <br />
            We just want to send a short email complimenting our guide Tien and
            our driver Tuen. We had the most incredible 2 night 3 day tour of
            the Mekong Delta. Tien was knowledgeable, excellent at planning when
            and for how long we would bike, took wonderful photos and is fun to
            have as a guide. Turn was always punctual and helpful. Tien and Tuen
            worked so well together. Everything else (food and lodging) was also
            excellent!
            <br />
            Thank you! It is a highlight of our trip! Highly recommended!!
            <br />

            Hello Ly,
            <br />
            <br />
            Good to hear from you! And congratulations on the coming new family
            member! Hope all is well.
            <br />
            <br />
            I was meant to write to you about my experience of the trip and give
            some feedback, but was very busy with work since I got back. I had a
            few free days in Saigon after the ride, but was tied up with other
            plans with family. I also was planning to visit your office to meet
            you, but did not have the opportunity either.
            <br />
            <br />
            First, I really like and appreciate Van Anh and Hien, the person who
            was driving the support van. They&apos; ve done everything to ensure
            my safety, the trip is enjoyable and were great companions
            throughout the trip. I learned so much more about Vietnam from them,
            even though I sort of growing up in the country. I never once felt
            unsafe during the whole trip. Van Anh is an impressive person and
            cyclist, I would love to ride with him again.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here is my thought about the ride:
            <br />
            <br />
            Except for the trail ride in Cat Tien National Park, a mountain bike
            is unnecessary. The rest of the ride was on paved road with some
            hills to climb, so a road bike is much more practical and enjoyable.
            A heavy mountain bike rides much slower, so increased time out on
            the road and restricted riding distance. And the hot summer weather
            could make the ride much less enjoyable for someone who was a
            cycling novice. My mountain bike fit me ok, except the handle bar
            was too wide so put a lot of stress on shoulder. I am also used to
            road bike, have not ridden a mountain bike for years. But I enjoyed
            the ride regardless, however will bring my road bike next time and
            only use your mountain bike for the trail ride. With a road bike, we
            perhaps can ride more if weather permits.
            <br />
            <br />
            The trail ride could be a bit longer, to 40-60km. I would not mind
            spending a day riding the trail then rest and continue road riding
            the next day. I am still kicking myself for forgetting to mount my
            GoPro camera on the bike for the trail ride. When we were riding, a
            large monkey ran across the trail right in front of us! That would
            be an image that I will show off and talk about for years to come!
            <br />
            <br />
            A note to the tour guide: remind everyone before the ride to set up
            their video camera on the bike if they have it. They may capture
            this kind of stunning, unforgettable images.
            <br />
            <br />
            I guess a majority of your clients are interested in travel tours
            with bike riding as secondary. But I recommend Vietnam Bike Tours to
            organize tours that are designed for cyclists and routes with
            different distance options. A seasoned cyclist would not be
            interested in only short rides and will look elsewhere for “real”
            cycling tours. I personally prefer bike tours that are designed more
            for cyclists, those that involve at least 60-100km a day of riding.
            There are many cyclists, both Vietnamese and American, in the US who
            would love to go on this kind of rides and willing to pay for one.
            <br />
            <br />
            I learned from Facebook that there are many cyclists in Vietnam who
            are doing just this, self-supported.
            <br />
            <br />
            Why don’t you plan one and see if there is any interest? Also make
            sure the ride is in the time of year that the weather is relatively
            nice, not so hot and humid? :-). Such as in Spring?.
            <br />
            <br />
            As for next year Saigon-Hoi An ride in March, I of course would love
            to go on this tour, now that I know what to expect. Two other
            friends of mine are also interested in the ride. A possible option
            is if the ride ends at Hoi An, the three of us could extend it to
            Hue afterward. Please send me the details when you have them (how
            many people signed up already, route plan and cost, when do I need
            to sign up).
            <br />
            <br />
            Last, thanks so much Ly, for setting this up for me! I really
            enjoyed the ride and will definitely join Vietnam Bike Tours on
            another future ride.
            <br />

            Thank you so much for the pictures. They are wonderful.
            <br />
            I wonder if you could share them in drop box so it would
            <br />
            be easier for us to download.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would also like to take the opportunity to thank your team,
            <br />
            especially Ms Ly for organizing the tour, Mr Nyugen for being
            <br />
            a terrific guide, Ms Phuong for documenting the trip and of course
            the driver for always being available (Sorry, I can&apos; t remember
            his name). We really enjoyed the bike ride from Hue to Hoi An.
            Everything was very well organized. Mr Nyugen was the best and most
            knowledgeable guide we had during our two-week stay in Vietnam. I
            would love to do another bike tour, especially in the south since
            I&apos; ve heard so many nice things about the Mekong Delta.
            <br />
            <br />
            My only recommendation is that although the Merila Hotel in Danang
            was very nice; it was far from the centre of town. We would have
            preferred being downtown (i.e., near the beach walkway) so that we
            could have enjoyed the evening there rather than at the hotel.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once again, thank you very much.
            <br />
            With warm regards,
            <br />

            Dear Ngo Trong Huy
            <br />
            We enjoyed the Cycling Tour with Vietnam Bike Tour a lot. We had the
            possibility
            <br />
            to see and explore parts of Vietnam with beautiful landscape and
            scenery.
            <br />
            The mix of sport and culture was perfect.
            <br />
            There are some points where you can improve. Sometimes the guide put
            food in
            <br />
            our plate which we didn&apos; t want to eat. I think each guest
            should decide by himself
            <br />
            what he want to taste. Also one hotel wasn&apos; t very nice. The
            bathroom was completly
            <br />
            green (little plants.. I don&apos; t know the word in English). But
            in total we liked the tour.
            <br />
            Best regards,
            <br />

            Hello Kim
            <br />
            <br />
            We had a fantastic trip with Tiger who showed us the beauty of the
            Mekong delta. Tiger took very good care of us and we loved the tour.
            Even if our saddle pain was uncomfortable..... But the bikes were
            fine. I would say a soft saddle for the ladies would be a good thing
            😄
            <br />
            The home stays were lovely and the food very good. So a big thank
            you to Tiger for a great tour.
            <br />
            And thank you to you for the organization. We will certainly
            recommend your company to friends and family.
            <br />
            Kind regards

            Vietnam/Cambodia Bike Tour 25-31 January 2015
            <br />
            Our overall experience with Vietnam Bike Tours is ★★★★★
            <br />
            From the first e-mail contact with Mrs. Kim Anh, we experienced
            professional guidance in choosing what, when and how we wanted this
            adventure. Every step of the way was efficient, easy and in the end
            a real joy.The choice of hotels and restaurants was varied and more
            than acceptable. The final hotel in Angkor Wat was a genius stroke…a
            cut above our standard hotels, it was just what we needed at the end
            of our 11-day trip.Our only criticism is that the first bicycle for
            the female in our duo was simply too big. It was new, the seat
            adjustment was as good as it could be, but it was still too large as
            getting on and off the bike was always a hassle. She adjusted as
            well as possible, but were this not a problem, the trip would have
            been perfect.This problem could be solved by including a smaller
            model in the inventory of bikes.
            <br />
            Our Vietnam guide for our January 25-31st bicycle trip through
            Vietnam, Mr. Tien Truong, was professional, personable,
            knowledgeable and caring. From the first encounter with us at the
            airport until our leaving at Chau Doc, he was a delight and made us
            comfortable. His handling of most every detail, from mid-morning
            snacks to hotel reservations/placement was outstanding. He was
            patient in finding a solution to a medical problem (which was
            eventually solved by his own home remedy), concerned about the
            quality of our food and drink, and tolerant and informative with our
            many questions. We have made a new friend and will recommend both
            Tien and the company to others. It was truly a great experience for
            us. Ruth Higgins

            <br />
            We enjoyed the trip, the beautiful nature, the friendly people and
            the delicious vietnamese food and we were very content with our
            guide &apos; Tony&apos; and Ming!
            <br />
            The only downside was the hotel in A Luoi, you may reconsider
            another place to stay.
            <br />
            Best regards,
            <br />
            Victor and Viola
            <br />
            PS. The Hoi An Chic Hotel was a perfect place to relax.
            <br />

            Hello Ms. Ly,
            <br />
            Don and I can’t begin to express how wonderful our experience was.
            The reviews will reflect that. I also offer to be available should
            any potential customer wish to contact me for questions or further
            information. I know that was helpful to me when I was planning our
            trip.
            <br />
            All of the guides were incredible but we were particular fond of Mr.
            Tien and Mr. Haun. Having the same guide for the entire Vietnam
            experience seemed to work better for us. While the guides in
            Cambodia were good, the fact that we had so many different ones
            wasn’t preferable. They all did fine but the continuity seemed
            stronger in Vietnam. I assume this couldn’t be avoided. No
            complaints; just something of a personal preference.
            <br />
            Mr. Tien is really quite exceptional. You should know that. He
            quickly understood our needs and seemed to provide us with a
            customized version of the trip. Not seeing other tourists, taking
            new routes to accommodate the road construction, choosing fruits
            that he knew we preferred and even wiping off the chopsticks with
            fresh limes before we used them… all attention to detail that was
            above and beyond our expectations.
            <br />
            He also photographed our riding and sent us dozens of photos. It was
            so nice to have photos of both of us together. He is a treasure and
            an asset to your company.
            <br />
            Thanks again for this amazing vacation. I am telling everyone I know
            about it and recommending it to all adventure seekers.
            <br />
            Best regards, Jenn Sommermann

            Dear Mr Ngo
            <br />
            We had a wonderful bike tour with Tien Feb 26 - March 1. He was an
            exceptional guide, very responsive to our needs and provided a very
            personal approach in engaging a number of the local people through
            the four days. These exchanges really enhanced our experience. We
            feel we better understand and appreciate Vietnam and her people.
            <br />
            <br />
            We were pleased with the accommodation, especially the food at our
            first home stay, and the bikes and the van support.
            <br />
            As an aside, we did find the food portions very much more than we
            are used to. Although it is included in your notes, we regret we did
            not appreciate the need for smaller luggage until we were on the
            journey. Perhaps a note included with your booking emails will help
            other travellers realize that small is better.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you.
            <br />
            Daniel & Maureen
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            Hi,
            <br />
            I just wanted to give a little feedback on the 3 day cycling tour we
            went on last weekend. The trip was wonderful and our guide, Mr. Gia
            (Jacky), was great. He showed up early to pick us up and was ready
            to go every morning well before we were done with breakfast. He was
            always upbeat and energetic as well as friendly and talkative with
            locals. Jacky made it clear that the schedule was flexible and was
            able to accommodate our requests. I really appreciated his guidance
            on this trip.
            <br />
            <br />
            One suggestion I&apos; d like to make is the addition of a small
            saddle bag or frame bag to the bicycles. Just something big enough
            to fit a mobile phone and wallet would be useful.
            <br />
            <br />
            For your information, my friend, Jane Pek, booked the trip.
            <br />
            Thanks,
            <br />
            Angela Yuan

            To Whom It May Concern,
            <br />
            I would like to take this opportunity to let your company know that
            we were very pleased with our tour and our guide Mr Kim, who took us
            on a 4 day 3 night tour of the Mekong at the beginning of January.
            <br />
            <br />
            We found him to be very knowledgeable of the area and much of the
            route that we took was lovely. We found that he listened to our
            needs after encouraging us to reach our potential. He was a happy
            and interesting guide who was interested in taking us on an
            informative tour.
            <br />
            <br />
            Both of us will have recommend Mr Kim as a guide along with your
            tour company. We enjoyed the home stays that we stayed in during our
            tour and found the people that we dealt with along the way very
            welcoming. The tour was more diverse than we expected and we were
            very pleased with the tour and what we did and saw. We have both
            spoken highly and recommended our tour to others and have referred
            to it as one of the highlights of our trip to Vietnam.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you have any questions please email me.
            <br />

            <br />

            Dear Ly,
            <br />
            We have come back from our fun adventure bike tour in the Mekong
            Delta last week led by bike guide Mr. Hai. I would just like to let
            you know that Mr. Hai was absolutely fabulous with us. He was
            extremely knowledgeable about the area, vegetation, fruits, people,
            customs, and of course knew all the back roads like his inside
            pocket! He was very friendly, patient, and accommodating to our
            wishes (especially stopping and taking hundreds of pictures). He
            was/is a fantastic bike tour leader and I will recommend him to
            anyone who asks. I only have very high praise for his
            professionalism and skills as a bike tour leader.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for our wonderful time in the Mekong Delta with Mr. Hai
            and Vietnam Bike Tours.
            <br />
